# Cruise Ship Project - All Aboard!

Welcome to the second project I completed as during my time as part of Command Shift (FKA Manchester Codes). This project covered a lot of core JavaScript and ES6 principles which helped me gain a deeper understanding and ways to apply these to projects and my own code.

### Live Page: https://cruise-ships.netlify.app/

## Guide

Don't be alarmed by the blank sea staring back at you when you first open the project!

The first thing we need to do is create a starting port and render a ship.

Select the "Add Port" button and add your first Port. This will automatically give the ship a place to dock and it'll be rendered.

Keep adding ports at any time and you'll be able to sail to the different ports using the "Set Sail!" button.

By default all sounds are set to mute. Hit the mute icon to enjoy the soothing sounds of the sea.

## Concepts Covered

- Domain Modelling
- Object-oriented Programming
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency inversion
- Mocks
- Spies

## Jest Installation

If you'd like to play around or fork the repo you'll be required to install jest to get the tests running.

Install Jest using `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```
